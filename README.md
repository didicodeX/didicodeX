# 👋 Hi there, I’m Dylane Tano — aka **@didicodeX**

I'm a self-taught **Full-Stack Web Developer** based in Canada 🇨🇦, passionate about building **beautiful and intuitive web apps**. I specialize in **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, and I’m always seeking to sharpen both my technical and product-thinking skills.

## 🚀 What I’m focused on

### 🧠 Frontend – React & Next.js
- Building scalable UIs with **Zustand**, **TanStack Query**, and **Tailwind CSS**
- Using **modern routing**, layout nesting, and advanced component composition
- Translating **Figma designs** into clean, responsive interfaces

### 🔧 Backend – Node.js & Next.js API
- Designing maintainable APIs using **layered** and **feature-based architectures**
- Integrating **Socket.io** for real-time interactions
- Mastering **MongoDB Atlas**: relations, aggregations, triggers, and cloud features

### 🎨 UI/UX & Product Thinking
- Applying solid **UI/UX principles** to create user-centered designs
- Developing a true **product vision**: solving real problems, not just technical challenges
- Inspired by both code **and** craft ✏️ (yes, I used to draw a lot!)

### 🔐 Web Security (Essentials)
- Implementing best practices in **authentication, validation, and protection**
- Securing APIs and UIs (JWT, CSRF, XSS, sanitize, HTTPS headers, etc.)

## ⚡ Fun fact
I started with C++ and C#, but my heart now belongs to **React**. You’ll probably never catch me doing .NET again — unless a client insists 😉.
